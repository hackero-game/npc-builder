<h2>Lost Webpages</h2>

Googled for the Hindi word for murder a bookmark can save your day!</p>
<h2>Find new webpages</h2>
<p>Mark Wise (78) recently got a modem and now explores the world wide web on his own. He already found many pages he likes, but the ones with bears are his favourites. "I always feel happy after visiting these pages. bears are just so relaxing" he explained. However Mark is pretty sure there must be more on the Internet than his favourite bear page so he asked our reported for some hints on how to find new webpages.</p>
<p>The great answer is YES! there are ways. Some websites keep small references to other pages. They can be hidden in the footer or on subpages. A great example is <a href="#" onclick="browserActions.openPage(this, 'coffeegreen.com')">coffeegreen.com</a> which references the website building tool they used to create their page. But not just that! Adds sometimes can also be a great reference to find other webpages. so keep you eyes out for these small little helpers. and also everytime you click on a add you make a bird wearing a suit really happy by making dollar signs appear in its eyes. So keep your eyes open for small references, adds and other hints. This search for hints makes your online experience really amazing!</p>
