    <h1>How to hack others on the internet</h1>
    <p>Have you ever seen a popup of your antivirus software saying you got infected? And then you got scared that all you data might be stolen? Well I guess everyone has experienced this situation once. Apparently there is a new webpage which claims to teach how hacking others work.</p>
    <p>As explained on their page hacking is really easy and everything you need is, according to their page, a software that is good enough to bypass a firewall. We've asked&nbsp;Jaidan Collins a computer security expert how easy it actually is. He said it is actually that easy to hack other systems and he has no Idea why his job is still needed. But according to him the most difficult part is not the hacking itself but to get appropiate software. As these often use unknown exploits they sometimes must be purchased on forums in the deepweb. to access this it is neccessary to install a software called onionproxy. It allows to connect webpages using a .onion address. Since most platforms selling the needed software are only accessible over the onion services without having a onion browser getting started in hacking can be difficult except someone can help you.</p>
    <p>Since we do great journalism we have added the links to the mentioned webpages below:</p>
